diffxml Version 0.96 BETA
patchxml Version 0.96 BETA
 
README file for diffxml and patchxml
====================================

diffxml and patchxml are tools for comparing and patching XML files. 

As opposed to the standard Unix tools diff and patch, which operate on a
line-by-line basis, diffxml and patchxml operate on the hierarchical tree
structure of XML documents, yeilding much more meaningful results.

To build and run diffxml please refer to the INSTALL file.

Please note that this is a beta release; it should not be considered
production quality.  diffxml and patchxml are released under the GNU GPL
Version 2.
